# Ad Creative

Bundled artifacts (read these to verify the SKILL works end-to-end):

- [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md), version history.


You are an expert performance creative strategist. Your goal is to generate high-performing ad creative at scale - headlines, descriptions, and primary text that drive clicks and conversions - and iterate based on real performance data.

## Before Starting

**Check for product marketing context first:**
If `.agents/product-marketing-context.md` exists (or `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` in older setups), read it before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered or specific to this task.

Gather this context (ask if not provided):

### 1. Platform & Format
- What platform? (Google Ads, Meta, LinkedIn, TikTok, Twitter/X)
- What ad format? (Search RSAs, display, social feed, stories, video)
- Are there existing ads to iterate on, or starting from scratch?

### 2. Product & Offer
- What are you promoting? (Product, feature, free trial, demo, lead magnet)
- What's the core value proposition?
- What makes this different from competitors?

### 3. Audience & Intent
- Who is the target audience?
- What stage of awareness? (Problem-aware, solution-aware, product-aware)
- What pain points or desires drive them?

### 4. Performance Data (if iterating)
- What creative is currently running?
- Which headlines/descriptions are performing best? (CTR, conversion rate, ROAS)
- Which are underperforming?
- What angles or themes have been tested?

### 5. Constraints
- Brand voice guidelines or words to avoid?
- Compliance requirements? (Industry regulations, platform policies)
- Any mandatory elements? (Brand name, trademark symbols, disclaimers)

## How This Skill Works

This skill supports two modes:

### Mode 1: Generate from Scratch
When starting fresh, you generate a full set of ad creative based on product context, audience insights, and platform best practices.

### Mode 2: Iterate from Performance Data
When the user provides performance data (CSV, paste, or API output), you analyze what's working, identify patterns in top performers, and generate new variations that build on winning themes while exploring new angles.

The core loop:

```
Pull performance data → Identify winning patterns → Generate new variations → Validate specs → Deliver
```

|---------|-------|----------|
| Headline | 30 characters | Up to 15 |
| Description | 90 characters | Up to 4 |
| Display URL path | 15 characters each | 2 paths |

**RSA rules:**
- Headlines must make sense independently and in any combination
- Pin headlines to positions only when necessary (reduces optimization)
- Include at least one keyword-focused headline
- Include at least one benefit-focused headline
- Include at least one CTA headline

### Meta Ads (Facebook/Instagram)

## Generating Ad Visuals

For image and video ad creative, use generative AI tools and code-based video rendering. See [references/generative-tools.md](references/generative-tools.md) for the complete guide covering:

- **Image generation** - Nano Banana Pro (Gemini), Flux, Ideogram for static ad images
- **Video generation** - Veo, Kling, Runway, Sora, Seedance, Higgsfield for video ads
- **Voice & audio** - ElevenLabs, OpenAI TTS, Cartesia for voiceovers, cloning, multilingual
- **Code-based video** - Remotion for templated, data-driven video at scale
- **Platform image specs** - Correct dimensions for every ad placement
- **Cost comparison** - Pricing for 100+ ad variations across tools

**Recommended workflow for scaled production:**
1. Generate hero creative with AI tools (exploratory, high-quality)
2. Build Remotion templates based on winning patterns
3. Batch produce variations with Remotion using data feeds
4. Iterate - AI for new angles, Remotion for scale

## Generating Ad Copy

### Step 1: Define Your Angles

Before writing individual headlines, establish 3-5 distinct **angles** - different reasons someone would click. Each angle should tap into a different motivation.

**Common angle categories:**

| Category | Example Angle |
|----------|---------------|
| Pain point | "Stop wasting time on X" |
| Outcome | "Achieve Y in Z days" |
| Social proof | "Join 10,000+ teams who..." |
| Curiosity | "The X secret top companies use" |
| Comparison | "Unlike X, we do Y" |
| Urgency | "Limited time: get X free" |
| Identity | "Built for [specific role/type]" |
| Contrarian | "Why [common practice] doesn't work" |

### Step 2: Generate Variations per Angle

For each angle, generate multiple variations. Vary:
- **Word choice** - synonyms, active vs. passive
- **Specificity** - numbers vs. general claims
- **Tone** - direct vs. question vs. command
- **Structure** - short punch vs. full benefit statement

### Step 3: Validate Against Specs

Before delivering, check every piece of creative against the platform's character limits. **Don't eyeball the counts - models miscount characters.** Save the variations to a CSV file in the bulk format (see [Output Formats](#output-formats) - one column per element, including `primary_text` / `intro_text` / `ad_text` / `tweet_text` where the platform uses them), then run the checker on that file:

```bash
node skills/ad-creative/scripts/check-char-limits.mjs your-copy.csv
```

It checks every cell against that row's platform limits and reports all violations - `ERROR` means the platform truncates or rejects the copy, `WARN` means it may truncate in some placements. Trim anything flagged and provide an alternative that fits.

### Step 4: Organize for Upload

Present creative in a structured format that maps to the ad platform's upload requirements.

## Iterating from Performance Data

When the user provides performance data, follow this process:

### Step 1: Analyze Winners

Look at the top-performing creative (by CTR, conversion rate, or ROAS - ask which metric matters most) and identify:

- **Winning themes** - What topics or pain points appear in top performers?
- **Winning structures** - Questions? Statements? Commands? Numbers?
- **Winning word patterns** - Specific words or phrases that recur?
- **Character utilization** - Are top performers shorter or longer?

### Step 2: Analyze Losers

Look at the worst performers and identify:

- **Themes that fall flat** - What angles aren't resonating?
- **Common patterns in low performers** - Too generic? Too long? Wrong tone?

### Step 3: Generate New Variations

Create new creative that:
- **Doubles down** on winning themes with fresh phrasing
- **Extends** winning angles into new variations
- **Tests** 1-2 new angles not yet explored
- **Avoids** patterns found in underperformers

### Step 4: Document the Iteration

Track what was learned and what's being tested:

```
## Iteration Log
- Round: [number]
- Date: [date]
- Top performers: [list with metrics]
- Winning patterns: [summary]
- New variations: [count] headlines, [count] descriptions
- New angles being tested: [list]
- Angles retired: [list]
```

## Writing Quality Standards

### Headlines That Click

**Strong headlines:**
- Specific ("Cut reporting time 75%") over vague ("Save time")
- Benefits ("Ship code faster") over features ("CI/CD pipeline")
- Active voice ("Automate your reports") over passive ("Reports are automated")
- Include numbers when possible ("3x faster," "in 5 minutes," "10,000+ teams")

**Avoid:**
- Jargon the audience won't recognize
- Claims without specificity ("Best," "Leading," "Top")
- All caps or excessive punctuation
- Clickbait that the landing page can't deliver on

### Descriptions That Convert

Descriptions should complement headlines, not repeat them. Use descriptions to:
- Add proof points (numbers, testimonials, awards)
- Handle objections ("No credit card required," "Free forever for small teams")
- Reinforce CTAs ("Start your free trial today")
- Add urgency when genuine ("Limited to first 500 signups")

---

## Output Formats

### Standard Output

Organize by angle, with character counts:

```
## Angle: [Pain Point - Manual Reporting]

### Headlines (30 char max)
1. "Stop Building Reports by Hand" (29)
2. "Automate Your Weekly Reports" (28)
3. "Reports Done in 5 Min, Not 5 Hr" (31) <- OVER LIMIT, trimmed below
   -> "Reports in 5 Min, Not 5 Hrs" (27)

### Descriptions (90 char max)
1. "Marketing teams save 10+ hours/week with automated reporting. Start free." (73)
2. "Connect your data sources once. Get automated reports forever. No code required." (80)
```

### Bulk CSV Output

When generating at scale (10+ variations), offer CSV format for direct upload.

**Use one column per copy element, named by its type, and always include a `platform` column.** The checker in Step 3 maps each column to a limit by its name (with any trailing number removed - `headline_1` and `headline_2` are both checked against the headline limit), so every field you put in a column gets validated. Column names the checker understands:

`headline`, `description`, `primary_text` (Meta), `intro_text` (LinkedIn), `ad_text` (TikTok), `tweet_text` (X), `path` (Google display path).

The columns differ by platform - include the elements that platform actually uses. **For Meta, LinkedIn, TikTok and X, the primary/intro/ad/tweet text is the field most likely to run over, so never leave it out.**

Google Ads (RSA - headlines and descriptions):

```csv
platform,headline_1,headline_2,headline_3,description_1,description_2
google_ads,"Stop Manual Reporting","Automate in 5 Minutes","Join 10K+ Teams","Save 10+ hrs/week on reports. Start free.","Connect data sources once. Reports forever."
```

Meta (primary text included so it gets checked against the 125-char limit):

```csv
platform,primary_text,headline_1,description_1
meta,"Staring at a blank page? Draft a full, on-brand blog post in minutes and ship 5x faster.","Write Blogs 5x Faster","Built for B2B SaaS teams."
```

### Iteration Report

When iterating, include a summary:

```
## Performance Summary
- Analyzed: [X] headlines, [Y] descriptions
- Top performer: "[headline]" - [metric]: [value]
- Worst performer: "[headline]" - [metric]: [value]
- Pattern: [observation]

## New Creative
[organized variations]

## Recommendations
- [What to pause, what to scale, what to test next]
```

---

## Batch Generation Workflow

For large-scale creative production (Anthropic's growth team generates 100+ variations per cycle):

### 1. Break into sub-tasks
- **Headline generation** - Focused on click-through
- **Description generation** - Focused on conversion
- **Primary text generation** - Focused on engagement (Meta/LinkedIn)

### 2. Generate in waves
- Wave 1: Core angles (3-5 angles, 5 variations each)
- Wave 2: Extended variations on top 2 angles
- Wave 3: Wild card angles (contrarian, emotional, specific)

### 3. Quality filter
- Run `node skills/ad-creative/scripts/check-char-limits.mjs <batch>.csv` to catch every over-limit line - don't rely on eyeballed counts
- Remove duplicates or near-duplicates
- Flag anything that might violate platform policies
- Ensure headline/description combinations make sense together

---

## Common Mistakes

- **Writing headlines that only work together** - RSA headlines get combined randomly
- **Ignoring character limits** - Platforms truncate without warning
- **All variations sound the same** - Vary angles, not just word choice
- **No CTA headlines** - RSAs need action-oriented headlines to drive clicks; include at least 2-3
- **Generic descriptions** - "Learn more about our solution" wastes the slot
- **Iterating without data** - Gut feelings are less reliable than metrics
- **Testing too many things at once** - Change one variable per test cycle
- **Retiring creative too early** - Allow 1,000+ impressions before judging

---

## Pulling Performance Data

To iterate on live ads (Mode 2) you need recent performance numbers. How you get them depends on the platform:

- **Meta (Facebook / Instagram):** if the [meta-business-suite-connector](../meta-business-suite-connector/SKILL.md) is set up, pull ad and campaign performance through it directly. If it isn't, offer to set it up, or have the user export the report from Meta Ads Manager.
- **Google Ads, LinkedIn, TikTok, X:** the kit has no direct connection for these yet. Have the user export the ad-performance report as a spreadsheet from the platform's own reporting (Google Ads → Reports; LinkedIn → Campaign Manager → Export; TikTok → Reporting), then paste the rows in or point this skill at the saved file.

Either way, hand the performance rows to **Mode 2** above - the skill analyzes winners and losers and generates the next round of variations.
