# OpenClaw Workshop — AI Business Assistant Kit

**Built by Selr AI — [selrai.com.au](https://selrai.com.au)**

> Give your business an AI assistant that remembers who you are, learns your business, and gets smarter every time you use it — without writing a single line of code.

---

## What Is This?

This kit sets up a personal AI business assistant on your laptop. Not a chatbot you close and forget — an assistant that:

- **Remembers your business** — your name, your customers, your biggest challenges
- **Lives on your computer** — runs locally, not in a browser tab
- **Controls your browser** — can open websites, fill forms, and do research for you
- **Has 86 specialist skills** — research, copywriting, sales emails, social content, competitor analysis, and more
- **Gets smarter over time** — every conversation builds on the last

It is built on [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) by Anthropic — the same AI that powers Claude, configured specifically for your business.

---

## Who Is This For?

**Workshop attendees** — follow the setup guide below. Your assistant will walk you through everything.

**Developers** — see [DEVELOPER.md](DEVELOPER.md) for the full technical breakdown, architecture, and how to extend or customise this kit.

## How It Works

```text
Your Laptop
    └── VS Code (your workspace app)
         └── Claude Code (your AI assistant)
              ├── CLAUDE.md (your assistant's instructions + memory loader)
              ├── memory/ (saves what it learns about you)
              ├── skills/ (86 specialist skills)
              └── Playwright (browser remote control)
```

**Two steps, then you are up and running:**

| Step | What Happens |
|---|---|
| **1. Bootstrap** | Paste the bootstrap prompt into Claude Code — it clones the repo, copies skills, and creates your workspace |
| **2. Open workspace** | Open `~/my-assistant/` in VS Code and start Claude Code — the CLAUDE.md agent handles onboarding, asks 7 questions about your business, and runs a live demo |

After that, every time you open VS Code and type `claude`, your assistant already knows who you are.

---

## Quick Start

**Before the workshop**, complete these 3 steps — takes about 15 minutes:

1. Get a **Claude Max** subscription at [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) ($100 USD/month)
2. Install **VS Code** at [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com)
3. Install the **Claude Code extension** inside VS Code (search "Claude Code" in Extensions)

**Windows users:** also install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org) — see [docs/WINDOWS-SETUP.md](docs/WINDOWS-SETUP.md) before arriving.

No other pre-installs needed on Mac.

---

## At the Workshop

1. Open VS Code and start Claude Code in the terminal
2. Copy the **bootstrap prompt** from the workshop Notion page and paste it into Claude Code
3. Claude handles everything: clones the repo, copies skills, creates your workspace
4. When it finishes, open `~/my-assistant/` in VS Code and start Claude Code
5. The CLAUDE.md agent takes over — it greets you, asks about your business, and shows you what it can do

Your assistant handles it all conversationally, one step at a time. No scripts to run, no commands to memorise.

---

## Your 86 Skills

Skills are specialist capabilities your assistant can use. Think of them like switching your assistant from "general helper" to "expert copywriter", "market researcher", "DevOps engineer", or "product strategist" for a specific task.

This kit includes the full professional skill library — the same depth used to power Selr AI's infrastructure. See [docs/SKILLS-REFERENCE.md](docs/SKILLS-REFERENCE.md) for descriptions of every skill, and [docs/BOOTSTRAP.md](docs/BOOTSTRAP.md) for the version-controlled bootstrap prompt.

## Common Questions

**Is my data private?**
Yes. Your memory files (`~/my-assistant/memory/`) live on your computer only. Nothing is sent to a third party except your conversations with Claude (which go to Anthropic, same as using claude.ai normally).

**What does it cost after the workshop?**
Claude Max is $100 USD/month (~$155 AUD). That is the only required cost. Everything else in this kit is free.

**What if I miss a step during setup?**
Your assistant will notice and offer to fix it. Just open `~/my-assistant/` in VS Code, start Claude Code, and it will pick up where you left off.

**Can I use this on Windows?**
Yes. See [docs/WINDOWS-SETUP.md](docs/WINDOWS-SETUP.md) for the complete Windows walkthrough.

**I am a developer — how do I customise this?**
See [DEVELOPER.md](DEVELOPER.md).
